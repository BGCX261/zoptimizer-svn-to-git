This cross-tool-chain contains building utilities for multiple languages.

Note:
  Currently, those "interpretive languages" are not included. E.g.:
  - PHP
  - JavaScript (Minifier)
  - CSS (Minifier)
  Instead, they're included as third_party packages.

This tool-chain includes:

- cc (C++ Programming Language)
  This package provides the support for C++ Programming Language, and includes
  base utilities for native runnables as well.

  - crosstool-NG (Cross-Platform Building Toolchain Builder)
    crosstool-NG aims at building toolchains. Toolchains are an essential
    component in a software development project.

  - Dmalloc (Debug Malloc Library)
    The debug memory allocation or dmalloc library has been designed as a drop
    in replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other
    memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities
    configurable at runtime.

  - LTRACE
    ltrace intercepts and records dynamic library calls which are called by an
    executed process and the signals received by that process. It can also
    intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.

  - STRACE
    strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out a
    trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/

  - sstrip.c
    sstrip is a small utility that removes the contents at the end of an ELF
    file that are not part of the program's memory image.
    Hacked by Manuel Novoa III to handle targets of different endianness and/or
    elf class, making it more useful in a cross-devel environment.
